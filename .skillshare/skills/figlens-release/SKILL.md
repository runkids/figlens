Prepare or review a figlens release. A version argument is the requested version, not permission to commit, merge, push or publish.

Before acting, run `python3 scripts/ai-context.py release`. That topic is the source of truth for the automation; this skill is only the order of steps.

Identify the authorized scope: preparation or publication. An explicit request to publish includes the necessary Release PR merge and Publish Release dispatch; continue within that scope without asking again. Bypassing required reviewer approval needs explicit authorization for that bypass.

## 1. Find the pending release

Inspect Git status and preserve unrelated work. From the repository root:

```sh
gh release list --limit 3
gh pr list --label 'autorelease: pending' --state open
```

The open Release PR holds the next version and its CHANGELOG entry. No PR: check the latest "Release Please" run (`gh run list --workflow release-please.yml --limit 3`) and the repository setting that lets Actions create pull requests. Dispatch the workflow only when the user authorizes it.

Requested version: set `"release-as": "X.Y.Z"` on the `.` package in `.github/release-please-config.json` through a PR, confirm the Release PR moves to that version, and remove the setting in the first PR after the release. A `Release-As:` footer is lost, because squash merges here keep only the PR title.

## 2. Review the Release PR

- The version follows the policy in the `release` topic; a breaking change needs migration notes in the CHANGELOG.
- `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` and `npm/package.json` carry the same version.
- The tracking manifest agrees with that version.
- Every user-visible `feat` and `fix` in `<last tag>..origin/main` is reflected in `README.md`, `skills/figlens/SKILL.md` and the wiki topics; fix stale docs on `main` first, then let the PR update.
- CI on `main` and the exact Release PR head is green. If bot-created PR checks need workflow approval, approve through GitHub's native prompt/API before waiting for results.

Report the version, the changelog entries and anything missing. Within the authorized scope, merge the reviewed head (`gh pr merge <n> --merge --match-head-commit <sha>`). If a required review blocks it, obtain a reviewer approval or explicit permission for an admin merge; keep all CI gates intact.

## 3. Check the draft

After the merge, follow the run until the "package" job finishes (`gh run watch`). Then:

```sh
gh release view v<version> --json isDraft,assets --jq '.isDraft, (.assets[].name)'
gh release download v<version> --dir samples/release-v<version> && (cd samples/release-v<version> && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS)
```

Confirm the tag points to the exact tested merge SHA and its Cargo/npm versions agree. Expect five archives (macOS arm64/x86_64, Linux musl arm64/x86_64, Windows zip) plus `SHA256SUMS`. Check each archive contains its executable and the tag's complete `skills/figlens/` directory, including `SKILL.md`, `references/audit.md`, `references/planning.md`, `references/planning-details.md` and `references/yolo.md`. Unpack the archive for this machine and run `figlens --version` and `figlens tree <a sample .fig> --depth 1`; for a bug fix, exercise the reported behavior with the packaged binary. Private designs and outputs stay in ignored `samples/`.

## 4. Write the release notes

Follow the release notes rules in the `release` topic. Write English user-facing copy to `samples/release-v<version>/notes.md`: the concrete problem, resulting behavior, a useful example or update command, and relevant verification or limitations. Scale the detail to the change. Review claims against the pending commits and actual checks; the generated CHANGELOG is input, not the finished copy.

Apply it to the completed draft before publication:

```sh
gh release edit v<version> --title v<version> --notes-file samples/release-v<version>/notes.md
gh release view v<version> --json name,body,isDraft
```

Verify the title is exactly `v<version>` and the body matches the notes file. Recheck both after a draft rebuild and restore the reviewed copy if needed. Keep the notes and private artifacts ignored; do not force-add them. Draft social announcements only when requested.

## 5. Publish and verify distribution

With publication authorized, run `gh workflow run publish-release.yml -f tag=v<version>`. Use this workflow so GitHub, Homebrew and npm all run. Watch it to completion and inspect each job. Investigate a failed channel before retrying; preserve the tag and version.

Verify the public result:

- GitHub marks the intended tag as latest, with the version-only title and reviewed body.
- Homebrew's published formula has the version and archive hashes from `SHA256SUMS`.
- npm exposes the requested version as `latest`, with both Pi extension and skill metadata. If npm reports processing and the registry still returns 404, wait and recheck availability; do not republish.
- Run `npx --yes @runkids/figlens@<version> --version` using isolated npm and binary caches under `samples/` (`npm_config_cache` and `XDG_CACHE_HOME`) so the check exercises the public package and download path.

Report the release link, shipped behavior, actual checks and each distribution result. Distinguish unpublished drafts, successful publication and pending or failed channels. Finish only after the authorized steps are complete or a concrete blocker is reported.
