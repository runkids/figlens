# Build Figma screens in Pi from a local `.fig`

Save the design from Figma, put it next to your code, describe the screen. Pi finds the frame, reads layout, text and assets, and builds it with your project's components. No Figma app, login or API calls. Works on a remote machine.

The same package has independent [OpenCode V2](../opencode/README.md) and [OMP](../omp/README.md) entries with their own tested limits. Pi keeps its existing commands and runtime registration.

## Install

Requires **Pi 1.3.0+**. One package ships the CLI, MCP server, viewer and agent skill:

```sh
pi install npm:@runkids/figlens
```

Restart Pi or run `/reload`. Run Pi from the project you want to build in. The extension registers the figlens MCP server automatically; an existing `figlens` server in your Pi MCP settings takes precedence. The first launch downloads and verifies the native binary. [Package page](https://pi.dev/packages/@runkids/figlens).

## Ask for the screen

In Figma, **File > Save local copy** → `design.fig` in your project. Then:

```text
Build the task board from ./design.fig.
Use this project's existing components and assets. Show me the result
and check it against the design.
```

Pi searches nested screens and resolves node IDs itself. If several frames match, it asks with recognizable names and sizes. React, Vue, Svelte and plain HTML use the same flow. The packaged [figlens skill](https://github.com/runkids/figlens/blob/main/skills/figlens/SKILL.md) has Pi compare the running UI with the design, verify fonts and images, run project checks and fix confirmed differences, then report what it could not check.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/figlens plan [request]` | Inspect the design and relevant code, write a plan. No edits |
| `/figlens yolo [request]` | Plan, implement, verify, then clean up its own temporary plan and exports |
| `/figlens open [description]` | Find a design from a file, screen name, purpose or visible text |
| `/figlens preview [description]` | Start the local viewer and return its link |
| `/figlens map` | Propose reusable component matches for the current design |
| `/figlens review` | Accept, edit or skip pending component mappings |
| `/figlens status` | Show the manual selection and mapping states |
| `/figlens close` | Stop the viewer and clear the manual selection |

None of these is required to build a screen. A plain request does the whole job.

### Plan

```text
/figlens plan Plan only the homepage hero from ./design.fig. Include existing component reuse, image delivery and acceptance checks.
```

A small region gets a small plan; several pages get an outline with the next slice detailed, or every slice detailed when you ask for the whole plan first. Without arguments it uses the task in the conversation and asks for missing source or scope. Saved plans go to `.figlens/plans/<scope>.md` (or `.figlens/plans/<design>/<scope>.md` when several designs are involved) unless the project has its own convention. The same [planning workflow](../skills/figlens/references/planning.md) works through the skill in other agents.

### YOLO

```text
/figlens yolo Implement only the task-board header from ./design.fig. Follow existing components and styles. Compare it with the design and run the relevant project checks.
```

Loads the [YOLO workflow](../skills/figlens/references/yolo.md): temporary plan, implementation, checks, corrections, then cleanup of that run's own files and processes only: its plan, the scratch files in its export directory (the verification summary and final screenshot stay) and the dev servers or browser sessions it started. Design departures, such as darker text for contrast, are listed in the report. Failed, interrupted or blocked work keeps its plan and exports. Existing plans and notes stay intact. Host permissions still apply; read the final report for the actual verification outcome.

### Preview

```text
/figlens preview ./design.fig
/figlens preview The homepage quick-entry card in ./design.fig
```

An existing path starts the viewer immediately. A description makes Pi resolve the file and screen first. The link is returned, not auto-opened; keep Pi running while you use it. `/figlens close` or session shutdown stops the viewer.

### Component mappings (optional)

```text
Save reusable matches between this design and our existing components.
Inspect the real imports, props and usage. Leave proposals for me to review.
```

Then `/figlens review` lists every pending proposal in the project with its source frame, implementation file, import, usage, rationale and conflicts. Accept, edit or skip. Decisions live in `.figlens/component-mappings.md`; commit it to share them. A mapping is reused when the same component and variant structure appears again, marked **stale** when its recorded files change, and left **unmatched** for a new variant. Non-interactive modes leave proposals pending.

## Advanced

**Source checkout.** Install a native `figlens` binary or set `FIGLENS_BIN`, then:

```sh
pi -e /absolute/path/to/figlens/pi/index.ts
# or save it in Pi's settings:
pi install /absolute/path/to/figlens
```

**Manual selection.** `/figlens open "./design files/mobile.fig" --frame 12:345` saves a known node and attaches a reference image (PNGs in `.figlens/previews/`, keep them out of Git). The legacy `/figlens frame [ID]` searches within that saved file. The selection is restored for manual commands next session; it is not injected as design context. `/figlens close` clears it and keeps mappings.

**Searching a design.** Ask Pi to find copy or a screen in a `.fig`: it searches the file directly and stores nothing. For repeated searches, ask it to *enable an index* for that design and a scope (for example "enable an index for ./design.fig, whole file"). With no setup command, Pi calls the MCP `index` tool to prepare a local index of that scope in the figlens state directory, polls `jobs` until the build succeeds, and from then on searches it by `workspaceId` and `node` set to the chosen scope and opens results with `inspect`, also after a restart or from another host. Pi has no built-in tool permissions: the MCP `index` tool declares `destructiveHint: true` and `jobs` declares it changes state, so a Pi permission extension can confirm them, and the shared skill tells the agent to reset only on your explicit request. Indexes go to the figlens state directory, or to a location an earlier `--storage` prepare remembered; the registered server has no `--storage-root`, so a new custom `storage` is refused. To allow one, add your own `figlens` server to Pi's MCP settings with the arguments `mcp --storage-root /absolute/dir` and run `/reload`; it takes precedence over the registered one.

**Finding usages.** Ask Pi where a component, variable, style or image is used: the agent calls the MCP `usages` tool with the exact layer or resource id, on the `.fig` directly (stateless) or, once an index is enabled, by `workspaceId`, the result's `sourceId` and the prepared scope; it never prepares, widens or resets an index for it. For a library component, style or variable, it passes `library` {kind, namespace, key}, taken from the `library` field of an outgoing `usages` result on a layer that uses it, with `workspaceId` instead: the layers in every visible prepared source whose cached copy uses it, with the definition left unresolved. Results carry exact refs, a `snapshotId` and coverage; a hidden-layer exclusion or a source that changed is reported, not read as "unused". It changes nothing, so it needs no confirmation.

**Searching by meaning.** Search by meaning or across languages needs an optional local model profile that you download yourself; figlens never downloads one. Ask Pi to list or check it: the agent calls the MCP `models` tool with `list` or `status`, then `configure` with the profile and the folder you downloaded (inside the server's `--root` folders when it has any), and searches with `mode` `semantic` or `hybrid`. Without a profile `semantic` is `mode_unavailable` and `hybrid` answers with text results. `configure` and `remove` change only the profile record under the figlens config folder; `remove` keeps the model files.

**Following changes.** Ask Pi to follow a design's changes, which opts in to that scope's index and history: the agent prepares the scope when no index covers it, then calls `index` `track` with the workspace and the scope, which builds a baseline as an index rebuild does, then subscribes with `watch` `subscribe`, reads `changes` with that `subscriptionId` and acknowledges each page it handled with `watch` `ack`; `watch` `unsubscribe` stops following, and `untrack`, only when asked, stops recording for everyone and keeps the history. `watch` `subscribe` with `sources` (`visible` or up to 10 sourceIds) instead of `sourceId` saves a search, or with `library` a library item's uses, over that fixed set; removing a member disables it, so unsubscribe and subscribe again. A `tracking` entry with `refreshRequired` means the file changed since its last build and `index refresh` records the change; an empty page never proves the file unchanged. Asking it to watch that scope runs `watch` `start`, which holds a lease while its figlens server runs, so each save is recorded without `index refresh`; `stop` or the session's end releases it, and the last release lets the shared background runner exit. `changes` changes nothing; `track`, `untrack` and the `watch` actions write only that workspace's database and never reset it, and `start` also launches that runner. Before each prompt Pi checks the subscriptions and consumers this session subscribed to or acknowledged (kept in the session file, so a resumed session keeps them) with a read-only `changes`, four per prompt under one 4 s deadline, and adds what it found to that run's model calls as data, without saving it in the session: unread revisions or evaluations (a baseline is marked as no design change), `refreshRequired`, a tracking state or evaluation that is not current, and targets it could not check with the binary's recovery. The status line says when design context may be stale; the note never acks or grants new authority, and with no subscribe or ack nothing runs.


**Searching by image.** Ask Pi to enable visual indexing for the design and scope: the agent calls `index` with action `visual` on the prepared scope and polls `jobs`. It then searches by `workspaceId` with an authorized local PNG in `image`, or an exact result reference in `imageRef`, and optional pixel `crop`; adding text uses `mode` `hybrid`. Hash matching works without a model; optional `siglip-base` configuration through `models` adds broader visual similarity. Query images are never stored, and similarity does not prove component identity. The live viewer offers the same image, crop and mode controls.

**Comparing revisions.** Ask Pi what changed between two saved copies of a design: the agent calls the MCP `diff` tool with `old` and `file` (local paths) and pages with `nextCursor`. Layers match by exact id and type only; `unknown` means a side stopped or left that layer unexpanded, not that it was removed. It reads both files and writes nothing.

**Agent tools.** The MCP `workflow` tool exposes on-demand build, audit, image, planning and opt-in YOLO guides from the same skill sources used by the commands above. For an existing UI, ask Pi to compare it with the design; the shared skill routes to `workflow(topic="audit")`, with no separate audit command. Static review and screenshot comparison are reported separately; fixes require a fix request. It returns guidance only; the current agent performs the authorized work with its project/browser tools. Besides the design tools (`tree`, `find`, `search`, `usages`, `inspect`, `nodes`, `variables`, `bundle`, `export`), the extension adds:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `figlens_preview` | Start a session-owned loopback viewer for `file` and optional `node`; return its URL |
| `figlens_bindings` | Read instances and approved/pending/stale mappings; 20 per page, `limit` 1–50 |
| `figlens_propose_bindings` | Save 1–20 pending candidates with target, import, usage, rationale, checks and issues |

Both binding tools take `file` + `frame` and do not change the manual selection. The extension runs with Pi's filesystem permissions; it is a workflow aid, not a security boundary.

**Print/RPC modes.** Design reading works without a picker. `/figlens plan` dispatches a model request; RPC clients wait for the final result, one-shot print clients send a normal planning prompt instead. A one-shot process cannot keep the viewer alive.

**Troubleshooting.**

- *Binary unavailable:* npm installs use the bundled launcher; source installs need `figlens` on PATH or `FIGLENS_BIN`.
- *Stale proposal:* ask for a new candidate after design or code changes; approval refuses changed evidence.
- *Guide modified or malformed:* the extension refuses to overwrite invalid state. Restore `.figlens/component-mappings.md` from Git.
- *Another writer:* remove `.figlens/.mapping-lock` only after the other Pi session has stopped.
- *Duplicate skill name:* if another installed skill is also called `figlens`, remove it so the package's instructions load.
