# figlens

A panel that reads a local Figma `.fig` beside your agents. Open a design, find a screen or any layer by name, text, node ID or Figma link, look at it full size, and hand it to the agent in the pane on the left as Build, Plan or YOLO after a confirm dialog that shows the exact message. figlens runs on the machine that holds the design, and the panel needs no figlens install.

## What you see

A card in the theme's `background`, `border` outline, radius 10. Every size is relative to the person's `ui_font_size` (base, 13 by default): title base + 1 semibold, body base + 0.5, secondary and buttons base − 0.5, labels base − 1 semibold, dialog titles base + 2. Secondary text is `muted`; `dim` only draws dividers and icons. Buttons are 28 high, radius 6: primary in `solid`/`solid_foreground`, secondary outlined in `border`.

- **Header**, 42 high: the figlens mark (`mark.svg`, 18 px) and `figlens`, the open file's name right-aligned in `muted`, a machine pill (`selected` fill, radius 10) when the file is on another Herdr machine, and a 24 px close icon button.
- **Toolbar**, pinned under the header once screens are known: a segmented control `Screens n · Components n · All n`, then a 30 px filter field (search icon, placeholder `Filter by name, text, node ID or Figma link`, `n of N` and a clear icon while it has text) and a 30 px fold-all icon button.
- **List**, scrolling: page rows (chevron, name, count; 30 high) fold and unfold. Screen rows are 60 high: a 72×48 thumbnail well in `chrome` (a dashed outline until drawn), the name, and `w×h · first text`. A selected row opens below it: a preview as wide as the panel (up to 360 high), the split button `→ Build with <agent>… | ▾`, a line naming the receiver (`Claude Code · space · tab · machine · focused on the left`), and quiet tools `Quick Look`, `Browser` (or `Snapshot`), `Node <id>`.
- Typing text also lists `Layers inside screens` (type, text or name, screen · page). A node ID or Figma link shows one node card instead: type pill, name, `in <screen> · <page> · w×h`, and the same details.
- **Nothing open**: a dashed 104 px target `Open a .fig file / Drop it here or click to choose`, then `Near your focus · <folder>` (and a machine pill) listing up to 20 `.fig` files as name and folder; `Follow focus` after picking a folder. Pinned at the bottom: `Images x MB · figlens y MB · copies z MB` and a trash icon button.
- **Engine needed**: `figlens needs its engine on <machine>`, what is downloaded and where (`~/.cache/figlens/npm/<version>`, shared with npx), `Download figlens <version>`; `Downloading…` with a spinning ring; an error and `Try again`.
- **Reading**: six skeleton rows. **Gone**: an alert, `This file is no longer there`, `Open another file`.
- **Status bar**, 34 high, when there is something to say: an icon and text in `ansi2` (done), `muted` (info), `working` with a spinning ring (`Reading…`, `Drawing thumbnails · n of N`, copy and snapshot progress), or `ansi1` (error).
- **Dialogs** (Herdr's confirm look: `popover`, 18 padding, 32 px buttons, radius 8, `Esc` hint): the confirm dialog (`Send “X” to Codex?`, `Plan “X” with Pi?`, `Let Claude Code build “X” on its own?` with a `working` bolt note), the receiver card with its status pill, the message in the terminal font, then Cancel and the action. The new-tab dialog lists installed agents, `Plan / Build / YOLO`, the exact first message, and `Open tab with <agent>`. The clear-cache dialog lists what goes and `Clear n MB`.
- **Handoff menu**: a popup under the caret in Herdr's menu style (31 px rows, 14 px icons): `Plan with <agent>…`, `YOLO with <agent>…`, a rule, `Start in a new tab…`, `Copy prompt`.
- **Quick Look**: a floating window, 920×660: name, `w×h · page · file`, the browser button, the split button and close; the screen at up to 1600 px on `chrome`; `‹ prev`, `next ›`, `n of N · Space or Esc closes · ← → moves`, or progress and errors.
- **Toggle** (`props: { role: "toggle" }`): `mark.svg` and `figlens` in the tab bar, styled as the tabs mod's Files and Changes; `selected` while the panel shows.

## How it behaves

- Agent status plays no part in the list. The receiver is only the agent focused on the left (Herdr's `agents()`), else the last one that was, since the panel's own keyboard focus takes focus away; a shell never receives.
- **Open**: drop, the system picker (`osascript` on macOS, `zenity` or `kdialog` on Linux, else a folder), or a nearby file. Each space keeps its own design in `shared("figlens.files.v1")`. A local design reloads on save (`watchFolder`); a remote one is polled every 10 s.
- **Engine**: `figlens` on PATH on the design's machine, else `~/.cache/figlens/npm/<VERSION>/figlens` there, else the download button. The download fetches the release archive and `SHA256SUMS`, checks the hash, extracts, and renames into place.
- **Screens**: `tree --json --depth 1` and `tree --top-frames --json` on the design's machine. Over 40 rows the pages start folded; a filter opens them all.
- **Images**: thumbnails only for screens in open pages of the shown kind, in list order, 12 per `export --frames` here or 40 per remote batch (sent back as one base64 tar.gz), at scale 3 and at most 216 px. Previews (960 px) and Quick Look (1600 px) scale a small node up so it stays sharp. Images are kept per file revision; only the newest 12 revisions stay.
- **Find**: `inspect` resolves an ID or link, then `find` by name (and type, and text for text layers) places it in its screen. Other text runs `find` for layers after a 300 ms pause.
- **Hand over**: every intent opens the confirm dialog. Enter confirms Build and Plan; YOLO only by its button. A blocked agent cannot receive (a paste could answer its question). On confirm, `hc send` pastes the message, the notice reads `Sent to …`, and Herdr focuses that agent. Pi and OpenCode get `/figlens plan|yolo <request>`, Claude Code `figlens workflow(topic=…)`, others a plain prompt naming the skill's `planning.md` or `yolo.md`.
- **Across machines**: when the design and the receiver are on different machines, the dialog says it copies the design first; the copy goes to `~/.cache/figlens/herdr-designs/<key>/` on the receiver's machine, once per saved version, and the message points at it. The CLI path is only named on the design's own machine.
- **Browser**: a local design starts `figlens preview` once as a hidden `hc run --bg` terminal and opens `<url>#node=<id>`; closing the design or the panel ends it. A remote design gets an offline snapshot made there and copied here.
- **New tab**: Herdr's `knownAgents()`; `tab.new` with the agent's argv and the chosen intent's message, in this space.
- **Cache**: the bottom row measures this panel's images, figlens's render cache (`figlens cache`) here and on the focused machine, and design copies; the trash button opens a confirm dialog, then clears all of them and every panel reloads.
- **Notices**: done and info notices leave after 4 s; errors stay until the next action.
- **Keys**: `/` focuses the filter, ↑ ↓ move between screens, Enter builds, Space opens Quick Look, Esc clears the filter, then the selection. Enter in the filter selects the first screen.

## Built from

- **One mod**, `mods/figlens/`. `mod.json`: `{ "place": "none", "title": "figlens", "focusable": true }`. As a pane: `pane.split {direction: "right", mod: "figlens"}`; in a layout as a block (the "Herdr + figlens" layout puts it in `panel-body` and a `{ role: "toggle" }` copy in the tab bar).
- `main.js`: the panel and its roles from `props().role`: `toggle`, `confirm`, `newtab`, `menu`, `clear`, `quicklook` (`openOverlay` dialog, popup and window). `gpui-kit` `div`, `image`, `svg`; `gpui-base` `h_flex`, `v_flex`, `InputState` + `Input`. Sizes from `S()` over `settings().ui_font_size`, colors from `theme()`.
- `engine.js` (no Herdr imports): `VERSION` (Release Please bumps it), the release asset per platform, the npm cache folder, and the install script.
- `frames.js` (no Herdr imports): pages and screens, thumbnail names, fitting, one-line design strings, `nodeRef` for IDs and Figma links, and the message for each intent and agent.
- `mark.svg` (the figlens mark, full color via `image`), `icons/*.svg` (stroke icons tinted with `svg`).
- **Storage**: `shared` keys `figlens.files.v1` (design per space), `figlens.notice.v1`, `figlens.quicklook.v1`, `figlens.viewers.v1`, `figlens.cleared.v1`; images under `~/.config/herdr-app/mods/figlens/.cache/`; design copies under `~/.cache/figlens/herdr-designs/`.
- **Herdr functions**: `exec` (with `on` for other machines), `hc`, `run` (`layout.select`, `layout.show`, `layout.hide`, `agent.focus`, `tab.new`, `terminal.kill`), `agents`, `focused`, `spaces`, `panes`, `knownAgents`, `pickFolder`, `watchFolder`, `openOverlay`, `closeOverlay`, `shared`, `setShared`, `nextCommand`, `theme`, `settings`, `layout`, `window`, `appHome`, `home`, `props`.
- **Programs**: `figlens`, `hc`, `sh`, `curl`, `tar`, `gzip`, `stat`, `find`, `du`, `dd`, the file picker, `open`/`xdg-open`.

## Watch out

- Never `cx.notify()` during render: work started from render (load, discovery, thumbnails) only sets state and spawns.
- Read block props with `props()`, not `init`'s argument. A panel clicked or given `pane.go` takes keyboard focus away from the terminal, so remember the last focused agent.
- `--max-size` only shrinks: draw small nodes with `--scale` or they blur.
- A remote command's output is cut at 8 MB, `hc file write` takes 8 MB and `hc put` 16 MB, and a mod's own file write is capped too: move large files in parts through `hc exec` (`dd … | base64` back, `dd | hc exec -i … cat >>` out) and let the shell write them.
- Herdr's default popup placement is wrong inside a floating window: place the menu from the caret's press position.
- A flex child holding wrapping text needs `min_w(0)`; a button in a column needs `self_start`, in a row `self_center`.
- Herdr's shipped layouts take no new docks: open the mod with `pane.split`, or use the "Herdr + figlens" layout.
- Not on Windows yet: the engine, discovery and copies use `sh`.

## Done when

- `herdr-app check mods/figlens` passes and `node --test herdr/tests/*.test.mjs` passes.
- With no figlens anywhere, opening a design offers the download and then lists its screens.
- Dropping a `.fig` lists its pages and screens with thumbnails; a design on another machine does too, without being copied.
- Typing a node ID or pasting a Figma link shows that node in its screen; typing text lists matching layers.
- Selecting a screen shows a sharp preview; Quick Look opens it full size and ← → move.
- Build, Plan and YOLO each open a confirm dialog with the exact message; Send pastes it into the agent on the left; a shell is never offered.
- With the design and agent on different machines, the dialog says it copies first, and the agent opens the copied path.
- The trash button asks first, then clears the images, figlens renders and copies.
