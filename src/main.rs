<file.fig>: a local path, or gs://bucket/object (downloaded with your gcloud login, cached in
  ~/.cache/figlens until the object changes).
<node>: a Figma URL with ?node-id=..., 12-345 (URL form) or 12:345.
        nodes/inspect/export/bundle also accept full instance sublayer IDs from inspect/nodes.
<out>: always explicit. Shipped assets go where the project keeps its assets; reference and
       scratch files go in .figlens/exports/ (holding a .gitignore of *), not beside the .fig.
JSON goes to stdout, errors to stderr; exit status 1 on any error.
